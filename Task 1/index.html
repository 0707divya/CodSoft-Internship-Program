              <p>2) I grew up in Paris (France), in a Mac family. My first interactions with a Macintosh was with my dad's Mac Performa during the dog days of Apple. At the time I wished we had a Windows PC, so I could play more games.</p>
              <p>3) But my love for the Mac really started at age 12, when my parents agreed to buy an iMac DV Special Edition and put it in my bedroom. I have some fond memories from that time, including staying awake late at night to watch a live webcast the Macworld 2002 keynote.</p>
              <p>4) I was around 16 when by I started becoming obsessed with Steve Jobs. My passion really picked up after reading The Second Coming of Steve Jobs by Alan Deutschman.</p> 
              <p>5) Though the book had a sardonic undertone, it fascinated me by recounting the story of Steve's nadir years at NeXT and Pixar, from his ousting from Apple in 1985 until his return in 1997.</p>
